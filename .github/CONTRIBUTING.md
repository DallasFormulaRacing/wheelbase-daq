# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this onboarding tutorial project. Your input helps improve the experience for future embedded systems team members and ensures the technical accuracy and clarity of our training materials.

## Contribution Overview

This project is a collection of structured tutorials designed to familiarize new members with the fundamental concepts, tools, and workflows used by our embedded systems teams. Contributions should maintain the clarity, accuracy, and pedagogical value of the existing content.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
If you encounter:
- **Minor issues** (typos, small formatting errors):  
  Please create a GitHub issue. If they are not critical, there's no need to submit a pull request immediately.
  
- **Major issues** (technical inaccuracies, broken content, other urgencies):  
  Please create a GitHub issue. Direct message the author/maintainer first. Make a pull request if you feel this is urgent enough.

### 2. Suggesting Improvements
- If you have an idea for improving the content, structure, or difficulty balance of the tutorials, open a GitHub issue describing your suggestion.

- Include a clear description of the changes in the PR body.
- Reference any related issues by number.

### 4. Style and Content Guidelines
- Keep explanations concise but informative.
- Use proper code formatting and markdown syntax.
- Align your additions with the tone and technical depth of the existing sections.
- When adding new tutorials or subtopics, include:
  - A **title**
  - A **difficulty level**
  - Clear **learning outcomes**
